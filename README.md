# Medical Segmentation on ACDC Dataset

## Dataset presentation

This project focuses on developing a Deep Learning model for medical image segmentation.
Specifically, it leverages the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset, which provides cine-MRI images of the heart. Each case in the dataset is manually annotated by clinical experts, highlighting three key cardiac structures:

- Left Ventricle (LV)
- Right Ventricle (RV)
- Myocardium (Myo)

The goal of this work is to automatically segment these regions of interest, which are critical for assessing cardiac function and detecting potential pathologies.

Below is an example of the dataset, including MRI images alongside their corresponding ground-truth annotations.
